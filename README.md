## description

we were given a functioning website and code, tasked with making the code more semantic. I started removing useless divs where 
elements could be used, from there i looked at the structure of the css and html to see where it could be as condensed as possible.
we also read through the site to see if there were alts for screen reading and made sure the active hyperlinks were working.
